## Method


1. The day before you plan to cook, place the saffron threads in a bowl, pour over them three tablespoons of boiling water and leave them to soak over night.

2. Next day, place the yeast into a large bowl with a teaspoon of sugar. Add four tablespoons of warm water and a tablespoon of the flour. Mix together and leave the mixture to form a spongy mixture.

3. Place the remaining flour and sugar in a very large mixing bowl. Add the butter sliced into small pieces and crumble together to give a fine bread crumb texture.

4. Stir in the dried fruit and lemon peel. Mix well.

5. Make a well in the centre of the mixture. Add a half pint of boiling water to the saffron and stir well. Pour this mixture into the well, then add the yeast and fold the mixture together.

6. Knead the mixture for least 15 minutes. It should then have a soft and elastic feel.

7. Cover the bowl with a clean, damp cloth and place it in a warm place such as an airing cupboard and leave until the mixture has risen to twice its previous size.

8. Knead the mixture once again, then divide the dough into two one lb bread tins and use the remaining dough to form round balls on a baking tray. Alternatively you can divide the dough into one bread tin and make more buns, or divide it all into buns, as required.

9. Place the tins and the baking tray in a warm place for another 20 minutes.

10. In the meantime preheat the oven to 180째C. Bake the cakes for 20 minutes at 180째C, then turn down to oven to 170째C and bake for a further 30 minutes. When the cakes are ready they will sound hollow when you tap the bottom.

11. The buns should be baked for 30 minutes at 170째C.

> #### Ingredients:
>
> - 1kg beef mince
> - 1 onion, finely chopped
> - 1 leek, roughly chopped
> - 7 garlic cloves, finely chopped
> - 70ml of soy sauce
> - 70ml of ketchup
> - 100g of brown sugar
> - 1 tbsp of cayenne pepper
> - 3 star anise
> - 4 dried chipotle chillies
> - 5 dried porcini mushrooms
> - 440ml of porter, or other dark beer
> - 1 1/2 tbsp of salt
> - 2 tbsp of oil, or lard




#### Method:


1. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil or lard in a frying pan over a medium heat and when hot, add the beef mince and brown.

2. Heat another tablespoon of oil or lard in an ovenproof casserole dish. Once hot, add the onions and leeks and cook down for 5 minutes. Add the garlic, cook for 3–4 minutes then add the soy sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, cayenne pepper, star anise, chipotles, mushrooms and beer

3. Cook uncovered for 30 minutes over a low heat, then add the beef mince to the pot. If there seems to be too little liquid to cover the ribs, add some water

4. Preheat the oven to 180°C/gas mark 4

5. Place the lid on the casserole dish and cook the beef mince for 3–4 hours.

6. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Once cool, transfer the beef to a tray and place the casserole back over a medium heat to reduce the sauce for another 20 minutes or so to make the glaze – you’re looking for a sauce that will thickly coat the back of a spoon.

7. When the glaze is ready, return the ribs to the sauce, rib-side down, and serve in the dish

8. Serve with rice.

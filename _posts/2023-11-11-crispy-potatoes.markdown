> #### Ingredients:
> 
> - 3 pounds yukon gold potatoes (small)
> - 1 whole head of garlic 
> - 3 large sprigs of thyme
> - 3 bay leaves
> - 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil

#### Method:

1. Wash potatoes and place in a cold pot of water. Generously salt with water and bring to a boil over high heat.

2. Once at a boil, reduce to a simmer over medium heat and simmer for 30 minutes or until  they are fork tender.

3. Once cooked, remove from heat and strain through a colander

4. On a cutting board, smash a whole head of garlic until you release the cloves. Place cloves skin on in a bowl and add thyme and bay leaves. Drizzle with olive oil and stir until everything is coated.

5. On a sheet pan, drizzle with olive oil and cover with flaky salt. Place potatoes on a tray in a single layer.

6. Take a small pan or a wide spoon and smash the potatoes lightly to create a flat surface on both sides. Once smashed and Â½ inch thick, pour over olive oil mixture making sure it is evenly dispersed. 

7. Place sheet tray in oven preheated to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and cook for 4-45 minutes or until the flat sides are crispy and brown.

> ## Ingredients
>
> - 2 Chicken breasts
> - 1.5 teaspoons (4.5g) kosher salt
> - 2 teaspoons (6g) garlic powder
> - 2 teaspoons (6g) nutritional yeast
> - 3/4 teaspoon (19g) fresh ground black pepper
> - 1/4 teaspoon (<1) onion powder
> - 1.5 (225g) cups all-purpose flour
> - 2 eggs beaten with a splash of water
> - 1.5 (19g) tablespoon water
> - 1.5 (113g) cups panko breadcrumbs
> - vegetable oil for frying



## Method

1. Slice each chicken breast in half, in a medium sized bowl mix with the salt, yeast, pepper, garlic power and onion powder.

2. Breading station: in three separate medium-sized bowls, add flour, egg+water, and panko crumbs. Fill a heavy bottom pot just over halfway with vegetable oil. Heat to 350F.

3. Coat your chicken patties in flour, shake off the excess, dip them in the egg mixture, fully covered (no dry spots), and then dip them into the panko. Make sure the patties get fully coated in panko.

4. Fry your patties, 2 or 3 at a time, for 4 - 6 minutes or until golden brown or the internal temperature reaches 165F. Remove and drain on a baking sheet with a wire rackâ€”season with salt and a pinch of mushroom powder to taste while hot. Repeat with the rest of your patties.

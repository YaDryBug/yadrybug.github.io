> #### Ingredients:
>
> - 500g Greek-style yoghurt
> - 200g Hobnobs
> - 60g unsalted butter, melted
> - 1Â½ tbsp thyme leaves
> - 400g full-fat cream cheese
> - 40g icing sugar, sieved
> - Finely grated zest of 1 lemon (1 tsp)
> - 150g white chocolate, broken into 1-2cm pieces
> - 60g honey



#### Method:


1. Line a 23cm springform cake tin with greaseproof paper.

2. Line a sieve with a clean tea towel and set it above a bowl. Spoon in the yoghurt, then draw up the sides of the towel and squeeze the yoghurt into a ball, pressing out as much liquid as you can: you should end up with about 350g thickened yoghurt.

3. Put the Hobnobs in a clean plastic bag and bash with a rolling pin until finely crushed. Mix with the butter and a tablespoon of thyme, then spoon into the base of the cake tin, pressing it down to form an even layer. Refrigerate while you make the cheesecake mixture.

4. Whisk the cream cheese, strained yoghurt, icing sugar and lemon zest until smooth (use a free-standing or handheld mixer).

5. Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of barely simmering water, making sure the base of the bowl is well clear of the hot water. Stir for two to three minutes, until the chocolate melts; take care not to get any moisture into the chocolate or it will seize up (white chocolate is much more temperamental than milk or dark). Scrape the chocolate into the cream mix and whisk together.

6. Spread the cheesecake mix evenly on top of the biscuit base, then refrigerate for two hours, until set.

7. To serve, warm the honey in a small saucepan with the remaining half-tablespoon of thyme leaves, until runny, then drizzle over the top of the cheesecake. Release the cheesecake from its tin, cut into eight slices and serve.

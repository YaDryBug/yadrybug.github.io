> ## Ingredients
>
> - 500 g (1lb) Chicken
> - 1 tbsp Olive oil
> - 1 tsp Salt
> - ½ tsp black pepper
> - 2 garlic cloves crushed
> - 3 cups Broccoli florets (Approximately 1 medium head of broccoli)

## For the cheese sauce
>
> - 3 tbsp Butter
> - 3 tbsp Flour
> - 1-2 cups Milk
> - 3 cups Cheese grated
> - 2 tbsp Parmesan cheese grated

## For the topping
>
> - 1 cup Panko breadcrumbs
> - 1 tbsp olive oil
> - 1 tsp Dried oregano
> - 1 tsp salt 



## Method

1. Cut the chicken into bite-size chunks then add to a bowl.

2. Drizzle over a few teaspoons of olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper.

3. Heat a large skillet or frying pan over high heat. Add the chicken in batches and sear until golden brown on all sides.

4. The chicken doesn't need to be fully cooked here as it will continue cooking in the oven. Remove and set aside.

5. Add the broccoli to the same pan, add a splash of water and cover with a lid. Allow to steam for 3 minutes then remove and set aside. 

6. In the same pan you cooked the chicken and broccoli, melt the butter.  

7. Whisk in the flour and cook for a minute then slowly whisk in the milk. Allow the sauce to simmer, whisking regularly, until the sauce is thick and smooth (approximately 5-7 minutes).

8. Remove from the heat then stir in the cheeses. Season with salt and pepper. 

9. Preheat the oven to 200°C/390°F.

10. Add the chicken to a casserole dish and top with the broccoli.

11. Pour over the cheese sauce.

12. In a small bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, a tablespoon of olive oil, oregano, salt and pepper. Scatter the crumbs over the cheese sauce. 

13. Place the casserole in the oven and allow to bake for 10-15 minutes or until golden and bubbling.

14. Remove from the oven, top with chopped parsley and serve.

> ## Ingredients
>  
> - 1 tbsp vegetable oil
> - 6 ounces boneless pork shoulder, diced
> - 1 yellow onion, diced
> - ½ cup diced celery
> - ½ cup diced green bell pepper
> - 1 tbsp paprika
> - 2 tsp ground cumin
> - 2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
> - ½ tsp cayenne pepper
> - ½ tsp garlic powder
> - ¼ tsp dried oregano
> - ¼ tsp dried thyme
> - 1 andouille sausage, diced, or to taste
> - 8 ounces chicken livers, minced
> - 2 cups long-grain rice
> - 2 tsp kosher salt, or to taste
> - 4 cups chicken broth
> - 1 bay leaf
> - 1 dash Worcestershire sauce
> - ¼ cup sliced green onions
> - ¼ cup chopped Italian parsley

## Method

1. Heat oil in a high-sided pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir pork until well browned and fat is rendered, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion, celery, and bell pepper; saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in paprika, cumin, black pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, oregano, and thyme. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables continue to soften, about 5 minutes.

2. Reduce heat to medium and add andouille sausage. Cook and stir to release some flavor, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in chicken livers and rice until well coated. Season with salt, pour in broth, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Add bay leaf and Worcestershire sauce. Cover tightly; reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, without stirring, until most of the liquid is absorbed and rice is starting to get tender, about 25 minutes.

3. Add green onions and parsley; mix well. Continue cooking over low to medium-low heat until rice is tender, about 10 minutes more. Taste for seasoning and remove bay leaf before serving.

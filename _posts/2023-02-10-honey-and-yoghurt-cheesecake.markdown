> #### Ingredients:
>
> - 900g ground beef (80:20 is good)
> - 1 (170g) can tomato puree
> - 1 litre of water
> - 1 (226g) can passata
> - 1 large onion, minced (about 3 cups)
> - 6 cloves garlic, minced
> - 3 tablespoons chili powder
> - 1 teaspoon ground cumin
> - 1 teaspoon cinnamon
> - 3/4 teaspoon ground allspice
> - 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
> - 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
> - 2 teaspoons kosher salt
> - 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
> - 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
> - 1/2 ounce unsweetened chocolate, optional




#### Method:


1. Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the tomato paste to the dry pot and cook, constantly scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula, until the tomato smells rich and toasty and you start to see browned (not burned) patches in the bottom of the pot. This should take 1 to 3 minutes. 

2. Remove the pot from heat and add the ground beef and water. Mix them together into a sludge. It will not look pretty, but press on. There's a method to this madness.

3. Return to medium-high heat and bring to a simmer, stirring all the while, so the sludge breaks up into a mealy paste. Add all the remaining ingredients except the vinegar and chocolate. 

4. Stir the chili often. You want the volume to reduce a bit. (To be honest, just one hour of cook time is okay, but for optimal chili-ness, go long.) 

5. Right at the end of your cooking time, add the vinegar and optional chocolate. 

6. Server over spaghetti with raw diced onions and finely shredded cheddar cheese.

> #### Ingredients:
>
> Makes about 2 quarts
>
> - 1 pound dried black beans, picked through, rinsed
> - 1 bay leaf
> - 1 medium onion, finely chopped, divided
> - 1 green bell pepper, seeds and ribs removed, finely chopped, divided
> - 8 garlic cloves, finely grated, divided
> - 5 teaspoons Diamond Crystal or 1 tablespoon Morton kosher salt, plus more
> - 1 teaspoon dried Mexican or Italian oregano, divided
> - 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil



#### Method:


1. Bring beans, bay leaf, ¼ cup chopped onion, ¼ cup chopped bell pepper, 1 Tbsp. grated garlic, 5 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 Tbsp. Morton salt, ½ tsp. oregano, and 5 quarts water to a boil in a large pot. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally and adding more hot water if needed to cover, until beans are tender and covered by about ¼" liquid, 2½–3 hours. Discard bay leaf.

2. Meanwhile, heat oil in a medium skillet over medium-low. Add remaining onion, bell pepper, garlic, and oregano; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are very soft and beginning to brown, 15–20 minutes. Stir into cooked beans. Top with cilantro, if using.

3. Do Ahead: Beans can be made 3 months ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze.

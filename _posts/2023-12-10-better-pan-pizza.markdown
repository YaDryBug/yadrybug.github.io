#### Method:

For The Dough 

1. In a large bowl mix together the flour, malt powder, sugar, and salt. 

2. In a separate container whisk together the warm water and yeast until dissolved. 

3. Add yeast mixture to the dry ingredients and mix by hand until a rough dough forms. Knead by hand for 5 minutes or until smooth. Form into a ball. Place in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the fridge to rise overnight. If you are in a rush you can rise the dough at room temperature for 2 hours but for best results do the overnight method. 

4. Remove the plastic wrap and punch down your dough. Divide into 3 even pieces (325g each), roll them into tight balls. 

5. Grease a sheet pan with cooking spray, lightly dust with flour and then lightly dust with the semolina. Place the dough on the prepared sheet pan, cover with plastic wrap and proof at room temperature for 2-3 hours.

For The Pizza Sauce 

1. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the olive oil. Once the oil is hot add the garlic and cook for 1 minute or until lightly toasted. Stir in the red pepper flakes, and toast for 30 seconds or until fragrant. 

2. Add the tomatoes, sugar, salt and pepper to taste, thyme and oregano. If you have the pepperoni, stir it into the sauce for added flavor, but this step is optional. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook for 8 minutes or until the sauce reduces and thickens. 

3. Pour the sauce into a bowl and season with salt to taste. Stir in the butter until melted and emulsified. Set aside. 

Cooking Method

1. Add the olive oil to a 10-inch cast iron skillet, making sure to coat the sides and bottom with the oil. 

2. Grab a piece of dough and shape it into a light ball. Place it in the center of the greased skillet. Press and stretch the dough as close to the edges as possible without tearing. Wrap it with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes. Repeat stretching the dough again until it reaches the edges. 

3. Finally, cover the dough with greased plastic wrap and let it be proof for 2-3 hours at room temperature. 

4. Preheat oven to a maximum temperature of about 500℉ / 260℃. 

5. Gently punch down the center, and add some sauce and cheese, leaving at least a ½-inch ring around the outside for the crust. Drizzle the top with olive oil, sprinkle with pepper and bake for 15-20 minutes or until the cheese is melted, the crust is deeply golden brown and crispy on the edges and bottom. 

6. Remove from the oven and brush the crust with garlic butter. Optionally garnish with thinly sliced chives, freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano, and a drizzle of spicy honey. Cut into slices and serve immediately.

> ## Ingredients
> 
> - Salt
> - 110g spaghettini (or spaghetti) 
> - 80ml olive oil
> - 3 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced
> - 1 large red chilli (10g), thinly sliced
> - 20g fresh oregano, leaves picked (about 15g net weight)
> - 2 tbsp white miso paste 
> - 1 tsp maple syrup
> - 400g cherry tomatoes
> - 160g nocellara olives (or other green olives), pitted and thinly sliced lengthways

## Method

1. Put two litres of water in a medium saucepan and salt well â€“ ie, with about three tablespoons. Bring to a boil, add the spaghettini, cook for six minutes (or according to the instructions on the packet), then drain.

2. While the pasta is cooking, put the oil in a medium saute pan on a medium-high heat. Add the garlic, oregano and chilli, and fry for two minutes, stirring frequently, until everything is crisp. Spoon half the mix into a small bowl, add the miso and maple syrup to the remaining mix in the pan and cook, stirring, for a minute more. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for another six minutes or so, until the tomatoes have burst and the sauce has come together.

3. Stir in the olives, toss the drained pasta in the sauce and serve at once with the reserved crisp garlic, oregano and chilli scattered on top.

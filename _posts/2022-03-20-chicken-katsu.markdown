> #### Ingredients:
>
> - 1 shallot
> - 1 Egg
> - 8ml soy sauce
> - 50g baby leaf salad
> - 20g mango chutney
> - 1 tbsp curry powder
> - 2 carrots
> - 15ml rice vinegar
> - 130g basmati rice
> - 2 british chicken breasts
> - 15g fresh root ginger
> - 30g panko breadcrumbs



#### Method:


1. Add the basmati rice and 300ml cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat
Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked
Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving

2. Top, tail and peel 1 carrot into a pile of ribbons
Grate the remaining carrot
Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger
Peel and chop the shallot

3. Crack the egg into a shallow bowl and beat lightly with a fork
Add 2 tbsp [4 tbsp] flour to a plate and season with salt and pepper, then add the panko breadcrumbs to another plate

4. Coat the chicken breasts in the flour, tap off the excess, then add to the beaten egg and finally press into the panko breadcrumbs firmly to evenly coat all over
Tip: If your chicken breast is a bit too thick, slice it in half horizontally so you’re left with two thinner pieces
Boil half a kettle

5. Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1-2 tbsp vegetable oil over a medium heat
Once hot, add the grated carrot, chopped ginger and chopped shallot and cook for 3 min
Add the curry powder and cook for a further 2 min
Add 1 tbsp flour and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the vegetables evenly

6. Add 300ml  boiled water and reduce the heat to low
Add the soy sauce and stir through the mango chutney
Cook for 5-7 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency
Season with a generous pinch of salt, cover with a lid and set aside for later – this is your katsu sauce

7. Heat a separate, large, wide-based pan with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat
Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 7-8 min on each side, pressing down firmly with a spatula until the outside is golden and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)
In a large bowl combine the rice vinegar with 2 tbsp [4 tbsp] olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your dressing

8. Slice the breaded chicken into strips
Spoon the katsu sauce onto the plate and serve the sliced breaded chicken over the sauce with the cooked rice and salad to the side
